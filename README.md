# Het_BBM
Implementation of the Heterogeneous branching Brownian motion simulations

BBM.py contains the function to simulates Branching Brownian motions,
as well as methods to obtain intermediate simulations to observe evolution,
to plot, and to plot the convex hull.

BranchingRates.py contains the branching rates that can be used.

test has different tests of the functions.
